<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a media scholar whose work examines technology and social inequality in comparative perspective. I have ongoing projects in the areas of: 1) new media and youth movements across democratic and non-democratic countries; 2) technology, design, and social justice; 3) digital labor and the future of work .</p>

<h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
<p><h3>New Media and Youth Movements in Comparative Perspective</h3>
  I am currently leading a qualitative study of 120 youth activists across democratic and non-democratic countries. I examine how young activists leverage social media to participate in movements while navigating surveillance, censorship, and other forms of repression in the digital age. This work is supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, the Spencer Foundation, and several other grants and scholarships. This work has been presented at the International Communication Association, the American Political Science Association, the American Sociological Association, and the Association of Internet Research. I have created and taught a graduate seminar on this topic.
  
  <h3>Technology, Design, and Social Justice</h3>
  
  In this initiative, I ask how do we design technologies for social justice in light of the advances in artificial intelligence. This work is informed by my professional experience as a software engineer in Silicon Valley. I have led workshops and presentations on technology design and social justice at the International Communication Association, the Graduate School of Design, Harvard Kennedy School, and the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. 
  
  <h3>Digital Labor and the Future of Work</h3>
  This initiative inquires into the changing nature of work in the platform economy. This new project connects with my past work with the UN in the areas of decent work, child labor/trafficking, and human rights.
